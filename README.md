Changeling: the Social Deception game is WIP web game set in an ancient forest, when a group of friends decide to venture into a forest to camp for the night, they realise that the rumours are not just rumours when one of them gets replaced by a changeling. Now, they must find out who, since Changelings are, by their very nature liars, and cannot tell the truth about their host's life.

* Each turn, a player asks a question, everyone else must answer.
* Changelings always lie, Campers may decide to, if they are to embarrassed to answer.
* Every five turns, there is one in three chance the campfire will go out and someone else will be replaced by a changeling.
* Otherwise, players vote to burn one of their own, whoever they think the changeling is.
* Survive the forty turns or burn the changelings! Or, alternatively become the majority as changelings to win.
