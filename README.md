Changeling: the Social Deception game is WIP web game set in an ancient forest, when a group of friends decide to venture into a forest to camp for the night, they realise that the rumours are not just rumours when one of them gets replaced by a changeling. Now, they must find out who, since Changelings are, by their very nature liars, and cannot tell the truth about their host's life.

You and a group of your friends have decided to travel into the woods near your town that is rumoured to be haunted. While setting up your camp for the night, one of you have been replaced by a Changeling, as you realise the strange happenings going on around you, you decide to ask each other questions only the real "you" can know, can you reveal the changeling or survive until the dawn? Or will you become another victim of the ancient forest and those that reside in it...
